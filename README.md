# Magento Extension for Campaign Monitor

Use your rich customer data in Magento to segment your customer base and send the personal, hyper-targeted email marketing campaigns that drive valuable ROI back to the business. **Send 2500 emails to 500 people for as little as $9/month.**


Research shows that personalized, relevant email marketing campaigns have at least 26% higher open rate than generic ones. By connecting Campaign Monitor and Magento, you can unlock this opportunity for your business and start sending hyper-targeted, personalized emails to your base. Joint Magento and Campaign Monitor customers are already automating emails to:

* Target VIP customers with a special offer
* Welcome every new customer with a personalized email
* Send gender and/or geographic specific content
* Re-engage customers who haven’t purchased in a while
* Celebrate an important date, such as a birthday

Campaign Monitor makes it easy for you to get started by automatically creating segments for you based on what we’ve found to be the most actionable audiences in Magento. Use these segments to automate marketing campaigns.
